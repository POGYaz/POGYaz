## 🧠 About Me

I'm an aspiring AI Engineer with a strong passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.  
My journey spans across machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision — guided by curiosity and hands-on experimentation.

I focus on developing AI models that enhance decision-making, automate processes, and drive innovation. With a growth mindset and commitment to impact, I aim to bridge the gap between research and practical applications.
